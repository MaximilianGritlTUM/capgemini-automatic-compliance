# *Epic 1: SAP Data Integration*

### *User Stories*

* As a user, I want the system to *connect to SAP*, so I can analyze master and transactional data.
* As a user, I want the system to *read SAP master and transactional data*, so I can assess compliance impact.
* As a user I want the system to treat SAP "material" and "product" terminology equivalently so that analysis is consistent and unified.
[[[* As a user, I want *EHS integration*, so I can expand regulatory checks.]]]

---

# *Epic 2: Object & Scope Selection*

### *User Stories*

* As a compliance analyst, I want to select which SAP object type to analyze (suppliers, products/materials, documents, BOM) so that the system evaluate the correct compliance scope(compliant, non-compliant or missing info).


---

# *Epic 3: Product & Material Compliance*

### *User Stories*


* As a user I want the system to identify material type (raw, semi-finished or finished) so that I can determine the current production stage/step.
* As a user I want to display and analyze multi-level BOM structure, so that I can understand material composition.
* As a user I want the system to compute compliance from sub-components, so that we can determine if the parent material is compliant or not.
---

# *Epic 4: Supplier Compliance & Activity*

### *User Stories*

* As a user, I want *transaction history for suppliers/materials* included, so I can assess relevance and business value.
* As a user, I want to know whether suppliers/products are *active or inactive*, so I focus only on relevant cases.


---

# *Epic 5: Market & Country Logic*

### *User Stories*

* As a user I want to use supplier's country/region when evaluating regulations, so that region-specific rules are applied correctly.
* As a user I want the system to consider the target market's country/region so that regulations are applied depending on export destinations.


---

# *Epic 6: Compliance Indicators*

### *User Stories*

* As a user, I want the system to *read compliance fields* from SAP, so I can leverage existing information.
* As a user, I want the tool to *interpret non-standard fields* (e.g., free-text “EUDR relevant”), so that I can determine the compliance of the component.


---

# *Epic 7: Transaction Relevance & Volume*

### *User Stories*

* As a user, I want to see *sales/purchase volumes and transaction frequency*, so I understand business impact.

---

# *Epic 8: Regulatory Configurator*

### *User Stories*

* As a user, I want a *configurator*, so that I can define criteria per regulation.
* As a user, I want the configurator to *support multiple regulations* (EUDR, CS3D/LkSG, Machinery, etc.), so I can use one tool for compliance checks.
[[[As a user, I want both *master-data checks* and optional *operational flow analysis*, so I can go from quick screening to deeper evaluation.]]]

Here are the **shortened epics (1–2 sentences max)** with the **correct user stories listed underneath**.

---

# ✅ **Epic 1 — SAP Connectivity & Data Acquisition**

Enable the system to connect to SAP and extract all relevant master, transactional, and compliance-related data, ensuring consistent terminology and usable inputs for analysis.

**User Stories**

* Connect to SAP to analyze master and transactional data.
* Read SAP master and transactional data to assess compliance impact.
* Read compliance fields from SAP.
* Interpret non-standard fields (e.g., free-text “EUDR relevant”).
* Treat SAP "material" and "product" terminology equivalently for consistent analysis.

---

# ✅ **Epic 2 — Object Selection & Scope Definition**

Allow compliance analysts to choose the SAP object type to analyze so the system applies the correct compliance scope.

**User Stories**

* Select which SAP object type to analyze (suppliers, products/materials, documents, BOM).

---

# ✅ **Epic 3 — Material Classification & Structure Analysis**

Provide understanding of material characteristics and hierarchical structure so the system can evaluate production stages and component relationships.

**User Stories**

* Identify material type (raw, semi-finished, finished).
* Display and analyze multi-level BOM structure.
* Compute compliance of parent materials based on sub-components.

---

# ✅ **Epic 4 — Supplier & Material Relevance Assessment**

Ensure the system evaluates only meaningful cases by including usage history, activity status, and transaction volumes.

**User Stories**

* Include transaction history for suppliers/materials.
* Identify whether suppliers/products are active or inactive.
* Display sales/purchase volumes and transaction frequency.

---

# ✅ **Epic 5 — Region-Based Compliance Evaluation**

Incorporate geographic information into compliance logic so regulations can be applied based on supplier origin and target markets.

**User Stories**

* Use supplier’s country/region when evaluating regulations.
* Consider the target market’s country/region when applying regulations.

---

# ✅ **Epic 6 — Multi-Regulation Configurator**

Provide a configurable rule engine that supports criteria definition and analysis across multiple regulatory frameworks.

**User Stories**

* Provide a configurator to define criteria per regulation.
* Support multiple regulations (EUDR, CS3D/LkSG, Machinery, etc.).
